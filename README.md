# Morse_code_en_decorder_OLED
Morse code en decorder based on Arduino with OLED SPI display. Word per minutes is adjustable by rotary-encorder.
As a by-product project to my Tiny computer project, I made an stand-alone Tiny Morse code encoder/decorder. 
The procedure to make and program is almost same as previous one,

but the hardware is not same any more.
